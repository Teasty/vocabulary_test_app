This is a rebuild of Vocabulary App, done as a test progect. Design and some elements were changed.

Task 2:
* In my opinion onboarding is too drawn out. It takes too much time and gives nothing to user. I suggest to implemet some of these questions into the main scrolling screen and olso add mor information about how to use the app.
* I think the app needs to implement some tests to practice words not only by memorizing words, but also by remembering words which you already seen.
